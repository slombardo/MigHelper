# MigHelper
This console application is a crude but effective tool to help recover files from corrupted Microsoft MIG backup file.  

After trying numerous "solutions" I was still not able to recover my lost files.  One such solution was [MigRecover](https://www.visser.com.au/blog/migrecover-for-microsofts-windows-easy-transfer/)
which resulted in the following error:

```
Error while trying to open the source MIG file. Error: 0x000003EE
```

Finally I gave up and wrote this little application and recovered all 85 gb of files.
